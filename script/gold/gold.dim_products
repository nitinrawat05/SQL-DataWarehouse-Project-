üìù View: gold.dim_products
========================================================================

üìå What this SQL script does:

- Creates a **dimension view** (`gold.dim_products`) for products using data from the silver layer.
- Assigns a **surrogate key** using `ROW_NUMBER()` to uniquely identify each product.
- Joins **CRM product info** (`crm_prd_info`) with **ERP category metadata** (`erp_px_cat_g1v2`) to enrich each product with category and subcategory information.
- Filters out **inactive or historical products** by excluding records where `prd_end_dt` is not null.
- Selects important product attributes such as:
  - Product ID, Name, Number
  - Category ID, Category, Subcategory
  - Cost, Product Line, Start Date
- Supports **analytics/reporting** by consolidating and cleaning product data into a consumable gold layer.
